tagline: In the Old Church
mission: Hunting Ground opened in April of 2012 with the mission to bring Baltimore small designers and brands, as well as wearable and affordable vintage clothing for men and women.
about: Hunting Ground buys daily from 12pm–6pm, no appointment necessary. We buy seasonally and only clothing 20 years or older (1930’s–1992ish). In addition to clothing, we accept shoes, bags, scarves and hats. We are not currently buying vintage jewelry or suits (men's or women's).
how: We will look through your items and determine what pieces are a good fit for our collection. All Items must be clean and in excellent condition. Please keep in mind that our merchandise is highly edited and focuses on styles that reflect current trends, so we may only accept a fraction of what you bring in. We will price items we would like to buy and you receive 30% of that price. We offer cash payment for a total buy of under $50, and a check for a buy totaling over $50.
trends: Check our Instagram feed for current trends and items we are looking for, or stop by our shop and get a feel for our style.
